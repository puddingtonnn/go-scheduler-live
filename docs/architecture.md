# Architecture

How a click on **Run** becomes a world of gophers, and which parts of that world
are real trace data.

## The pipeline

```
cmd/workload            separate process, runtime/trace, binary trace on stdout
      │ bytes
      ▼
internal/tracerun       run → bytes           (owns os/exec, nothing else)
      ▼
internal/traceparse     x/exp/trace → events  (the only package that imports it)
      ▼
internal/timeline       domain model + JSON DTO
      ▼
internal/api            HTTP handlers, clamping, cache
      ▼
web/                    Vite + TypeScript + PixiJS
```

Each arrow is a package boundary, and each boundary exists so the stage on
either side can be tested alone.

## Why the workload runs in a subprocess

Tracing in-process would record the server's own goroutines alongside the
scenario, and `GOMAXPROCS` could not vary per run. So `cmd/workload` is a
separate binary invoked per request:

- it writes **only the binary trace to stdout** — every log, error and
  diagnostic goes to stderr, because anything else on stdout corrupts the
  trace stream;
- `GOMAXPROCS` is a `-gomaxprocs` flag applied via `runtime.GOMAXPROCS` before
  `trace.Start`, not a scenario parameter: it is a property of the runtime, not
  of the workload;
- the workload self-limits via `-duration`, so a killed `go run` cannot leave a
  scenario spinning.

`tracerun.Run` invokes it through its **import path** rather than a relative
`./path`, so the server works from any directory inside the module.

Consequence worth knowing: the backend needs the Go toolchain and the module
source at runtime — it compiles the workload on demand. That is fine for a
local teaching tool, and it is the reason the dev server must not be exposed
publicly: it would compile and run code on request for anyone who can reach it.

## Package boundaries

| Package | Knows about | Deliberately does not know |
|---|---|---|
| `scenarios` | concurrency only | tracing, HTTP, the frontend |
| `tracerun` | `os/exec`, the workload binary | trace format |
| `traceparse` | `golang.org/x/exp/trace` | HTTP, scenarios |
| `timeline` | the domain model and its JSON shape | how events were obtained |
| `api` | HTTP, clamping, caching | how a trace is produced |

`api` receives a `TraceRunner` function as a dependency instead of importing
`tracerun`, so its tests run against a fake with no subprocess at all.
Timelines are cached under a `sync.Mutex`, keyed
`scenario|gomaxprocs|goroutines|duration`.

## The DTO

`timeline.Event` carries `gid`, `pid` and `mid` as `int64`, using **`-1` for
"no such resource"** — and none of them are `omitempty`, because `gid 0`,
`pid 0` and `M0` are all valid identities. Dropping a zero would silently
reassign an event to nothing.

`web/src/model/timeline.ts` mirrors this DTO by hand. It is the one place where
Go and TypeScript must agree; change one and change the other.

## HTTP API

- `GET /api/scenarios` → `[]scenarios.ScenarioInfo`
- `GET /api/run?scenario=&gomaxprocs=&goroutines=&duration=` → `timeline.Timeline`
- `POST /api/trace` (body: raw bytes of a `.trace` file) → `timeline.Timeline`

An unknown scenario is a `404`. Every other `/api/run` parameter is **clamped,
never rejected**: `gomaxprocs` to `[1, 8]`, `duration` to `[100ms, 10s]`, and
`goroutines` to the scenario's own `ParamSpec`. The upper bound on `gomaxprocs`
is a UI constraint (eight isometric stations fit the world), not a Go one.

`/api/trace` has no clamping to fall back on — an arbitrary uploaded trace is
**rejected outright** once it exceeds a limit, because there is no parameter to
adjust on the caller's behalf the way `gomaxprocs` or `duration` can be. Limits
(`internal/api/trace.go`):

| Limit | Value | Error `code` | HTTP status |
|---|---:|---|---:|
| body size | 16 MB | `too_big` | 413 |
| max events | 200,000 | `too_dense` | 400 |
| max observed Ps | 8 (`maxProcs`, same constant as `/api/run`'s `gomaxprocs` clamp) | `too_many_procs` | 400 |
| not a valid trace | — | `not_a_trace` | 400 |
| unreadable / malformed body | — | `unreadable` | 400 |

Unlike scenario runs, uploads are **never cached**: a scenario run's cache key
is `scenario|gomaxprocs|goroutines|duration`, but arbitrary uploaded bytes have
no equivalent natural key — hashing the whole body just to save a parse that
only happens once per upload isn't worth the complexity (see the comment on
`handleTraceUpload` in `internal/api/trace.go`).

## Scenarios

Registered in `init()` into a global map; a duplicate name panics at startup,
because that is a programming error and should be loud.

| Order | Name | Teaches |
|---:|---|---|
| 0 | `workstealing` | idle Ps steal from busy ones |
| 1 | `pingpong` | a ring of goroutines passing tokens; most wait on `chan receive` |
| 2 | `syscalls` | the M blocks in the kernel with its G; sysmon retakes the P (unix only) |
| 3 | `gcpressure` | allocation drives GC cycles: concurrent mark plus stop-the-world |
| 4 | `mutexhot` | one `sync.Mutex` serializes N workers regardless of P count |
| 5 | `leak` | goroutines block forever on a channel nobody writes to |

`syscalls` is `//go:build unix`; on Windows five scenarios register instead of six.

Adding a scenario is the cheapest way to contribute: one file, a `Register` call
in `init()`, and a test asserting the events it is supposed to produce.

## Frontend layers

```
model/timeline.ts   hand-written mirror of the Go DTO
      ▼
api.ts              fetch, or read the baked matrix when VITE_STATIC=1
      ▼
player/             pure stateAt(t) → WorldState, plus Player (virtual clock)
      ▼
scene/              PixiJS isometric world: gophers, P stations, M carriers
      ▼
ui/                 DOM chrome, event log, assumptions panel, i18n
      ▼
controls.ts / main.ts
```

`player/` is pure and fully unit-tested; the canvas is not. Anything that can
be a pure function — state folding, GC summary, layout, causality rows,
viewport math, share codec, i18n — lives outside the renderer on purpose.

Playback time: `1x` replays the whole run in about 90 seconds of wall time
(`BASE_WALL_MS`), normalized to trace duration. The absolute traces are tens of
milliseconds long. An earlier 45s pace made dense scenarios flicker, because
states changed faster than sprites could finish interpolating between them.

### Reading `mid`

`exptrace.Event.Thread()` is the M of the **executing context**, which is not
always the M you want. On `g_unblock` and `g_create` it is the M of the waker or
creator, not of the target goroutine; on a `p_stop` caused by `ProcSteal` it is
the M of the thief. So the frontend binds `mid` only on own-execution events —
`g_run_start`, `g_syscall_enter`, `g_syscall_exit`, `p_start` — and treats
everything else as a reset. The binding table lives in `stateAt` under vitest,
and the same invariants are mirrored in Go by `TestSchedulerInvariants`.

## What is real and what is reconstructed

The distinction is the point of the project, so it is enforced in the UI by the
always-visible **Assumptions** panel.

| Real trace data | Reconstructed or stylized |
|---|---|
| goroutine state transitions and block reasons | membership of a P's local run queue |
| P and M bindings on own-execution events | which goroutine was stolen (heuristic, flagged `Stolen`) |
| GC cycles, mark phases, STW durations | parked M's (the trace has no M lifecycle) |
| heap metrics (downsampled) | queue capacity: 6 shown vs 256 real |
| syscall enter/exit and sysmon retake | time scale, slowed thousands of times |
| — | for an **uploaded trace**, `numProcs` (lower bound: distinct Ps *observed* in the trace, not the true `GOMAXPROCS` the program ran with — the trace format doesn't record `GOMAXPROCS` itself) |

Reconstructions are marked `(reconstr.)` in tooltips and are kept **out of the
event log**, which shows only facts.

## UI states: picking what to replay, and how

The stage the player replays into can be filled two ways, plus a third state
for how it's viewed:

- **scenario picker** — one of the curated scenarios above, run on demand via
  `GET /api/run` and cached by its parameters.
- **custom-trace upload** — a visitor's own `.trace` file, via the chip next to
  the scenario chips (hidden on the static-demo build, since there is no
  backend to upload to) and the instructions/drop-target panel in
  `web/src/ui/uploadtrace.ts`. Not cached, not shareable via the URL share
  codec — only scenario runs have a stable, reproducible parameter set to
  encode.
- **present mode** — a distraction-free fullscreen view, toggled by `F`
  (`Escape` to exit) via `web/src/ui/present.ts`. It doesn't change what's
  replayed, only what chrome is on screen while it plays: a `body.present`
  CSS rule hides the header, timeline, controls and event log, leaving the
  legend and a small auto-hiding "wand" (play/pause, seek, time, close).

## Engineering traps

Hard-won; each one cost a debugging session.

- **`x/exp/trace` must support the local Go trace format.** The header reads
  `go 1.26 trace`. If `NewReader` rejects the version, update `x/exp/trace`.
- **Pace scenarios with CPU work (`busyFor`), never `time.Sleep`.** Sleeping
  parks the goroutine as Waiting, which empties the P stations and makes the
  world look dead. Unpaced channel or allocation scenarios generate millions of
  events (a 16 MB trace in 400 ms).
- **The netpoller trap.** `os.Pipe` and `os.File` go through the poller, so the
  G parks as Waiting, the M is never blocked, and `g_syscall_enter` never
  appears. A genuinely blocking syscall — and therefore an M↔P handoff — needs
  raw `syscall.Pipe` and `syscall.Read` on a blocking fd. `time.Sleep` is a
  timer park, not a syscall either.
- **`goEventType` must cover `Syscall→Runnable`.** A goroutine that leaves a
  syscall whose P was already taken maps to `g_unblock`; miss it and the
  goroutine stays stuck in the syscall zone forever.
- **`traceparse` filters and downsamples on purpose.** Ranges are reduced to
  meaningful GC phases (`stop-the-world`, `mark phase`), dropping
  `incremental sweep` and `mark assist` noise; heap metrics keep a ≥2 ms gap
  between samples of the same name. Without this, `gcpressure` alone produces
  tens of thousands of events.
- **`stop-the-world (start trace)` is not GC.** It is an artifact of starting
  the tracer, filtered out of GC phases — otherwise the UI claims a
  stop-the-world at t=0.
- **Test fixtures cannot be named `*.out`** — that pattern is gitignored. Hence
  `internal/traceparse/testdata/workstealing.trace`.

## Testing strategy

```bash
go test ./...                     # invariants and scenario anti-regressions
cd web && npx vitest run          # pure logic
node scripts/verify-controls.mjs  # Playwright control contract (needs both servers)
node scripts/shoot.mjs            # screenshots for visual review
```

`TestSchedulerInvariants` is the backbone: across every scenario it asserts that
the number of simultaneously running goroutines matches the raw trace and never
exceeds `GOMAXPROCS`, that no goroutine starts twice, that P assignments never
conflict, that an M runs at most one G, and that a syscall returns on the same M.
Scenario tests are anti-regressions with real thresholds — `syscalls`, for
example, requires at least five `g_syscall_enter` events and at least two
distinct MIDs on one P.

The visual layer is verified headlessly rather than by eye: `shoot.mjs` drives
the player through `window.gmp` and writes PNGs, and `verify-controls.mjs`
asserts a contract over every interactive control.
