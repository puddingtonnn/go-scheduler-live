// narrate returns a short sentence (in the current UI language) describing the
// most notable thing
// happening at t, for the "what's happening" caption. Empty when nothing notable
// is nearby. Pure and unit-tested.
//
// GC phase (STW / concurrent mark) is read from the folded `gcActive` so the
// caption stays consistent with the scene — it never claims stop-the-world after
// the range has ended (the previous version re-scanned raw events in an 8ms window
// and lied for ~8ms of trace time, i.e. seconds of wall time at 1x). Point events
// (steals, blocks, exits) still come from a short look-back window.

// captionWindowNs bounds the caption's look-back to the smaller of the 8ms steal
// window and 1% of the whole run, so a short trace (e.g. workstealing ~39ms, where
// a fixed 8ms is ~20% of the timeline and would persist ~9s of wall time at 1x)
// does not leave the caption describing something that scrolled off long ago.
